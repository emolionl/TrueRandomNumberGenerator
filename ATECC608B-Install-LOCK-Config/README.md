# Project Title

## Getting Started

To ensure the system operates correctly, follow these steps:

1. **Initialize Configuration:**
   - Run the configuration script to set up the necessary environment. This step is crucial as it locks the configuration settings, which are required for generating random numbers.

   - If the configuration is not locked, the system will not generate random numbers. The script will automatically check if the configuration is locked and notify you if it isn't.

2. **Verify Configuration Lock:**
   - After running the configuration script, ensure that the configuration is locked. The script mentioned above should handle this, but it's good practice to verify.
   - If the configuration is not locked, refer back to step 1.

3. **Proceed with Usage:**
   - Once the configuration is locked, you can proceed with the rest of the system's functionality, which includes generating random numbers.
   - To generate random numbers, use the following command:
     go to ATECC608B-basic-random and use main.cpp

## Additional Information

- For any issues during the setup, please refer to the troubleshooting section or contact support.
- Ensure all prerequisites are installed before running the configuration script.

Thank you for following the setup instructions carefully to ensure the system works as expected.
