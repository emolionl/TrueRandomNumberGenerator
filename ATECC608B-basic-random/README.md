## Getting Started

Before running the main application to generate random numbers, it's crucial to follow the setup instructions provided in the previous README.md to lock the configuration. This step is essential for the system's correct operation.

### Prerequisites

- Ensure that the configuration is locked as per the instructions in the ATECC608B-Install-LOCK-Config README.md.
- Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., GCC, Clang).

### Running the Application

1. **Compile the Program:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory containing `main.cpp`.
   - Compile `main.cpp`

2. **Execute the Program:**
   - Platform.io on Visual Studio Code

Follow these steps carefully to ensure the application runs correctly and generates random numbers as expected.
