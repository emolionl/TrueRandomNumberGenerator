# TrueRandomNumberGenerator
A True Random Number Generator (TRNG) exploits physical processes to produce numbers that are completely unpredictable, ensuring high security for cryptographic applications.

There are many ways to get the TRUE Random Number Generators. 

Here is documentation on how to make chip ATECC608B.
here are the steps to get it work:

1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFqVDmxOQjQ&ab_channel=Rudolf TODO - all wires photo
2. after wiring go and run -> ATECC608B-Install-LOCK-Config
3. get the basic Random numbers from repo -> ATECC608B-basic-random
